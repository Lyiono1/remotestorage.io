      <p>Not even 3 weeks left until the best RailsCamp ever – time to start warming up and announcing things! But first off, a big thank you to everybody who already contributed something, anything, to this unconference extraordinaire! You&#8217;re many, and it&#8217;s going great so far. Keep it up!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a short (obviously incomplete) summary of the current state of organization. Please dive in and help out with anything you like<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>, even if it&#8217;s just adding useful information to the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll have a <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/27'>beer garden</a> and a large <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/16'>hack tent</a> with beach chairs n stuff outside, and we can officially make noise there until 5am. The <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/36'>warm-up party</a> will also take place there, so if you want, you seriously don&#8217;t have to leave the venue at all from Friday until Sunday.</li>

<li>The setup indoors <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/21'>is</a> <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/29'>pretty</a> <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/23'>much</a> <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/13'>sorted</a> <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/3'>out</a>, and fortunately most of the material doesn&#8217;t even have to be shipped there, because the venue comes with all sorts of things like chairs, stage elements, etc.</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/28'>We still need some projectors</a> (or how the Germans among us like to call them: beamers). If you can bring one, please add a comment to the issue!</li>

<li>There&#8217;s going to be a <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/14'>Railscamp 5k Run</a></li>

<li>We&#8217;ll have <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/9'>über-awesome wi-fi</a>, courtesy of the CCC</li>

<li>We&#8217;re still trying to get a proper <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/34'>Internet uplink</a> secured. Hope for the best, or help get it done!</li>

<li>Our campers and Sailor sponsors of <a href='http://geekstammtisch.de/'>Geekstammtisch</a> will <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/37'>set up their podcasting studio</a> at the venue, and will probably even do live recording sessions if you&#8217;re interested. Furthermore, we&#8217;ll have a freelance journalist <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/15'>creating a short movie</a> about the camp.</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/8'>Ticket sales</a> are going well so far (more on that in the next post), and most of the first batch is gone. Fun fact: at the time of this writing, you contributed the average amount of 7 EUR more per ticket than the suggested price. Thank you, everybody!</li>

<li>We have a quote for a <a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/17'>coffee truck</a> (with flat rate and optional crêpe unit), but we still need sponsors for it (~500/day). Anyone interested in making <em>a lot</em> of campers <em>very</em> happy?</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/railscamp/railscamp-germany-2013/issues/30'>Rails Girls</a> will be officially part of the camp with sessions, app hacking, and more. Separate announcement/invitation coming up. Thanks to everybody involved in this so far!</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it for today&#8217;s status update. As you can see, we&#8217;re unstoppable by now, and it&#8217;s only getting even better by the day. <strong>Thanks again to everybody who contributed so far!</strong> And see you tomorrow for our next announcement!</p>

<p>P.S.: We also have <a href='/blog/feed.xml'>an Atom feed for the blog</a> now. Use any RSS/Atom reader to subscribe!</p>
