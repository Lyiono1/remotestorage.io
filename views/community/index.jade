        ### Meet people in person

        remoteStorage folks are travelling a lot, and it's rumored some of them
        don't even have a home address. So chances are good you can meet people
        in person, learn about remoteStorage at a conference, or even be part
        of a remoteStorage hackathon. Be sure to [follow us on
        Twitter](https://twitter.com/remotestorage_) to receive event
        announcements!

        [Check out the forums](http://community.remotestorage.io/category/events)
        for a list of past and upcoming events.

        #### The Unhosted Unconference

        Every year in September, we throw an unconference-style event in a small
        town called Unhost, right next to Prague. During these days we discuss
        the whole project, learn about new developments, work on issues, make
        larger decisions, and most importantly: have a lot of fun and learn to
        know each other. This year, we discovered there is also a small town called
        Unhos, near Lisbon, so we are going there on 29 June 2014, the day after LXJS.
