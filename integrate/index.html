        <p>Although you may choose to integrate remoteStorage sync in your
        server-side program, or using a custom client-side library, we
        usually recommend and assume you use
        <a href="https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js">remoteStorage.js</a>
        in a client-side web application. Here&#39;s a quick overview of how that
        works:</p>
        <h4 id="widget">1. The Widget</h4>
        
        <p><img class="widget" src="/img/widget.png" alt="widget"></p>
        <p>The remoteStorage widget allows your users to connect to their
        personal storage server. By default it is part of every app that uses
        remoteStorage.js. So every time a user sees the widget, they know
        that they can use their own storage with an app. You can customize
        the widget&#39;s appearance to better match your app&#39;s design, of course.</p>
        <h4 id="modules">2. Categories, Modules &amp; Schemas</h4>
        
        <p>(see also our <a href="/modules/code/files/documents-js.html">modules documentation</a>)</p>
        <p>remoteStorage data is stored in directories – also known as
        &quot;categories&quot; – for which your app requests access (either read-only or
        full). The user grants these permissions via OAuth during the first
        connect from your app.</p>
        <p>For common data, remoteStorage.js uses per-category modules, which
        provide a method of reading and writing a certain defined type of
        data, e.g. documents, contacts, or images. You can choose from a
        variety of common and custom modules that already exist, or build
        your own.</p>
        <h4 id="examples">Example Apps</h4>
        
        <p>Check out the demo app <a href="https://drinks-unhosted.5apps.com/">&quot;My Favorite Drinks&quot;</a>
        (<a href="https://github.com/remotestorage/myfavoritedrinks">source code</a>).
        There&#39;s also a starter kit with a
        <a href="https://github.com/remotestorage/starter-kit/blob/master/apps/hello-world">hello-world example</a>,
        so you can read the source code without the distraction of tasty drinks.</p>
        <h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>
        
        <p>We&#39;re still working on better guides and documentation (and you&#39;re
        invited to <a href="/community/">contribute</a>). However, the library&#39;s API
        documentation is up-to-date, and also includes some guides:</p>
